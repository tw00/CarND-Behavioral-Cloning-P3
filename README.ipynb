Although the project is fun and I learned a lot, I almost spend 100h on it (as well as paying 150$ to Amazon). I informed my mentor numerous times that I'm stuck with the project, I also consulted the forum, slack and the walkthrough video for more tips, but sadly nothing helped in my case.</span>"
